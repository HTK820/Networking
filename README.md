Networking Labs – Cisco Packet Tracer

This repository contains academic and practical networking labs completed as part of my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (Networking specialization).

The labs demonstrate core networking concepts using Cisco Packet Tracer, progressing from basic switching to advanced routing and security topics.

## Covered Topics
- VLAN configuration and verification
- Inter-VLAN routing (ROAS & Layer 3 Switch)
- Static routing (single & multi-router)
- Access Control Lists (ACL)
- EtherChannel (Layer 3)
- OSPF routing (single & multi-area)

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Cisco Routers & Switches
- IPv4 networking

These labs were created for learning and academic purposes and reflect hands-on practice with real networking scenarios.
