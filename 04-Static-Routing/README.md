# Static Routing Labs (Cisco Packet Tracer)

## Overview
This section contains Cisco Packet Tracer labs focused on **IPv4 Static Routing** concepts.  
The labs demonstrate how routers are manually configured to forward traffic between
multiple networks without using dynamic routing protocols.

These scenarios simulate **small to medium enterprise networks** and help build a
strong foundation in routing logic, subnetting, and network troubleshooting.

## Learning Objectives
By completing these labs, you will be able to:

- Understand how static routes work in multi-router environments
- Configure IPv4 static routes on Cisco routers
- Design and verify routing between multiple LAN subnets
- Troubleshoot connectivity issues using `ping` and `traceroute`
- Apply correct next-hop and exit-interface routing methods

---

## Lab Structure

Each subfolder represents a **separate static routing scenario**, organized by
complexity and topology design.
