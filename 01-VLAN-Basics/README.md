# VLAN Creation and Verification

## Overview
This lab demonstrates basic VLAN creation and verification using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
End devices are segmented into separate VLANs to isolate traffic between departments.

## VLAN Configuration
- VLAN 10 – Accounting (192.168.10.0/24)
- VLAN 20 – Sales (192.168.20.0/24)

## Devices Used
- Cisco 2960 Switch
- PCs assigned to different VLANs

## Key Concepts
- VLAN segmentation
- Access port configuration
- IP subnet separation

## Verification
- Devices within the same VLAN can communicate
- Devices in different VLANs are isolated without inter-VLAN routing
